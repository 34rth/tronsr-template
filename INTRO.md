## 34RTH
Our mission is to democratically evolve, guide and steer decentralization’s Raison d’Être.

We are democrats, technologists and philosophers at heart: we participate in the Tron Superrepresentative Election to guarantee that the pros and cons of each of the dimensions of decentralization are weighted and voted on democratically.
